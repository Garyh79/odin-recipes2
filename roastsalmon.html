    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Moist and tender salmon with a slightly sweet and salty crust—it's the perfect bite! This recipe is easy and a
        nice choice to serve for guests who aren't used to eating salmon. Garnish with lemon slices and fresh parsley
        and serve alongside rice pilaf or roasted sweet potatoes.</p>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
