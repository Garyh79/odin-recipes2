    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This recipe was passed to me by a friend whose husband loved Buffalo wings and baked potatoes. I made it for the
        first time and it was a big hit. Being short on time, I made some
        shortcuts to the recipe and to my surprise, it tasted even better.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 tablespoons hot pepper sauce</li>
        <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablesoon paprika</li>
        <li>8 potatos, cut into 1/2 inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves cut into 1/2 inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Mexican Cheese blend</li>
        <li>1 cup crumbled cooked bacon</li>
        <li>1 cup diced green onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Heat hot pepper sauce, olive oil, garlic powder, black pepper, paprika, and salt in a large skillet over low
            heat, stirring until thoroughly combined. Turn off heat. Toss potatoes in batches with the hot pepper sauce
            mixture to coat and use a slotted spoon to transfer potatoes to the prepared baking dish. Leave remaining
            sauce in skillet. Mix chicken into remaining sauce and allow to marinate while potatoes roast.</li>
        <li>Bake potatoes until tender inside and crisp and brown outside, 45 to 50 minutes, stirring every 10 to 15
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce oven heat to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Spread chicken cubes over roasted potatoes. Sprinkle Mexican cheese blend, cooked bacon, and green onions
            over chicken. Return to oven and bake until chicken is cooked through and the cheese topping is bubbling,
            about 15 minutes.</li>
